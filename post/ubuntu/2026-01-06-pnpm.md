**Yes — pnpm requires Node.js.**
pnpm is a JavaScript package manager, so it **cannot run without Node.js**.

### Minimum requirement

* **Node.js ≥ 16** (recommended: **LTS**, currently 18 or 20)

---

## Why Node.js is required

* pnpm is written in JavaScript
* It uses Node’s runtime, filesystem, and networking APIs
* Even when installed via Corepack or a script, Node.js must already exist

---

## Recommended way to install Node.js on Ubuntu

### ✅ Use `nvm` (best & safest)

This avoids system-level issues and lets you switch Node versions easily.

```bash
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.7/install.sh | bash
```

Reload shell:

```bash
source ~/.bashrc   # or ~/.zshrc
```

Install Node LTS:

```bash
nvm install --lts
nvm use --lts
```

Verify:

```bash
node -v
npm -v
```

---

## Then install pnpm (recommended)

Once Node is installed:

```bash
corepack enable
corepack prepare pnpm@latest --activate
```

Verify:

```bash
pnpm -v
```

---

## Summary

✔ Node.js **must be installed first**
✔ Use **nvm + Corepack** for the cleanest setup
✔ Avoid Ubuntu’s `apt nodejs` (often outdated)

If you want, tell me:

* your Ubuntu version
* whether this is for **frontend**, **backend**, or **monorepo**

I’ll suggest the best Node + pnpm setup for your case.
