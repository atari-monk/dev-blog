I observed that i do not care about making as many features in my game as i can. I am interested in finding optimal code form i like.

It sounds like you’ve discovered something important about your creative process: **you’re more motivated by shaping the code into a form you find elegant, expressive, or “right,” rather than by adding lots of features.**

That’s actually a valid and common motivation among many developers—especially those who enjoy software craftsmanship, architecture, or language design.

Here are a few thoughts that might help you explore this direction productively:

---

## ✅ **1. You may be more driven by aesthetics and clarity than by utility**

Some developers get joy from:

* finding the “cleanest” abstraction,
* designing a beautiful architecture,
* removing redundancy,
* achieving minimal, elegant solutions,
* discovering a pattern that feels *just right*.

If this is you, it’s not a flaw. It’s a sign of your personal developer identity.

---

## ✅ **2. That motivation can lead to mastery**

Focusing on optimal forms can help you naturally develop deep skills in:

* code architecture,
* API design,
* readability and maintainability,
* pattern recognition,
* language idioms,
* refactoring,
* conceptual elegance.

These are advanced skills that many feature-focused developers never develop as deeply.

---

## ✅ **3. But you may need to balance it to avoid the “perpetual refactor loop”**

There’s a known risk:

* code becomes the goal, not the product,
* progress slows,
* you reinvent things that don’t need to be reinvented.

If that happens, you can still keep your aesthetic motivation but set some boundaries, like:

* “Only refactor after I have a working slice finished.”
* “Refactor only when friction appears, not just for beauty.”
* “Let the game’s needs guide which patterns I optimize.”

---

## ✅ **4. You can intentionally embrace this as a *craft* identity**

If optimizing code form is what you love, you can choose paths where that’s a strength:

* engine development,
* tools development,
* libraries/frameworks,
* systems programming,
* technical leadership,
* code quality roles.

Game feature development doesn’t need to be your main joy—maybe the game is just a playground where you explore code design.

---

## ✅ **5. You can turn the game into a “concept lab” for coding styles**

For example:

* use each mechanic as a test of a new code pattern,
* try multiple architectures for the same system,
* treat features as experiments rather than goals.

This lets you explore structure without forcing feature bloat.

---

## If you want, I can help you:

* find coding styles or paradigms you might like,
* shape an architecture you’ll enjoy working on,
* make your game become a lab for discovering code elegance,
* identify why you gravitate toward certain code aesthetics.
