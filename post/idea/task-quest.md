**Game Idea: “TaskQuest – A Tiny RPG Powered by Your Daily To-Dos”**

A simple mobile RPG where your character only progresses when you complete real-life tasks.
Each time you tick something off your to-do list (cleaning your desk, finishing homework, sending an email), your hero gains XP, finds loot, or unlocks new areas. The game stays minimal: cute pixel graphics, a small world map, and short story chapters that open only when *you* get things done. By playing, you’re actually improving your productivity without stressing about it.
