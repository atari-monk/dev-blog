# Rules

- DRY
    - Don’t repeat code; keep each piece in one place.
    - Write it once, use it everywhere.
    - Avoid copy-pasting your brain into multiple places—let each idea live in one spot.

- KISS
    - Keep It Simple, Stupid.
    - Prefer simple solutions over complex ones.
    - Avoid over-engineering; clarity beats cleverness.
