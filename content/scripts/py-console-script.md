Great question — let’s break this down clearly!

When you want a Python script to be usable as a **console script** (a command you can run directly in the terminal after installing it with `pip`), you typically package it so `setuptools` or `pyproject.toml` can generate an **entry point** for you.

---

### ✅ **1️⃣ Minimum Python Script Structure**

Your Python script **doesn’t need any special structure**, but it should have a callable function — usually named `main` — that does the work.

**Example:** `my_script.py`

```python
def main():
    print("Hello from my console script!")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This lets you run it directly:

```bash
python my_script.py
```

But that alone **doesn’t install it as a command**. For that, you need packaging.

---

### ✅ **2️⃣ `setup.py` Example with `entry_points`**

If you’re using **`setup.py`**, you define a console script like this:

```python
from setuptools import setup

setup(
    name="mytool",
    version="0.1",
    py_modules=["my_script"],
    entry_points={
        "console_scripts": [
            "mytool = my_script:main",
        ],
    },
)
```

Then, when you install it:

```bash
pip install .
```

You can run:

```bash
mytool
```

---

### ✅ **3️⃣ `pyproject.toml` Example (modern)**

With **PEP 621** and `pyproject.toml`:

```toml
[project]
name = "mytool"
version = "0.1"

[project.scripts]
mytool = "my_script:main"
```

Same idea: `mytool` will call `main` from `my_script.py`.

---

### ✅ **Key points**

✔️ The script must define a **function** that your entry point calls.
✔️ The `if __name__ == "__main__":` guard is just for running directly — the console entry point doesn’t care about that.
✔️ The script must be in your package or module path.

If you’d like, I can help you write a full working example with `setup.py` or `pyproject.toml`. Just say **"yes"**, and I’ll tailor it!
