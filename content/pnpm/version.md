To install version `0.0.20` of `@atari-monk/fullscreen-canvas` using `pnpm`, you can run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
pnpm add @atari-monk/fullscreen-canvas@0.0.20
```

This will explicitly install version `0.0.20` and update your `package.json` accordingly.

### Optional: Save as exact version

If you want to avoid future automatic upgrades (i.e., pin the version without a caret `^`), run:

```bash
pnpm add @atari-monk/fullscreen-canvas@=0.0.20
```

Let me know if you also want to upgrade all dependencies or lock it with a specific range.
