Your project structure looks **perfectly reasonable for a small-to-medium TypeScript component library**, especially if you’re just getting started or building something custom for your own or your team’s use. Here’s a quick assessment and some optional suggestions to make it a bit more robust or standard if you plan to scale it or publish it:

---

### ✅ **Good parts**

* **Clear separation:**
  Each component (`generic-ui-container`, `log`, `scene-selector`, `toggle`) is isolated in its own folder with its `.ts` logic and `.css` styling.
* **Single entry point:**
  `src/index.ts` will presumably re-export all your components — good practice.
* **Test folder:**
  You have `test/` with a minimal `index.html` and `mock-game.ts` — good starting point for simple manual tests or playground.
* **Vite setup:**
  `vite.config.ts` + `tsconfig.json` suggest you have hot reload and TypeScript support handled.

### 🗂️ **Optional improvements** (if your goal is maintainability / publishable library)

1️⃣ **Use `components/` or `lib/` as root for components**

```plaintext
src/
 ├── components/
 │   ├── GenericUIContainer/
 │   │   ├── index.ts
 │   │   ├── styles.css
 │   ├── Log/
 │   │   ├── Entry.ts
 │   │   ├── Manager.ts
 │   │   ├── styles.css
 │   ...
```

This pattern:

* Makes clear which folders are reusable components vs utils or helpers.
* Keeps naming PascalCase for consistency.

---

2️⃣ **Co-locate CSS with component entry**

Right now, you have `.css` in each folder, which is fine — just ensure they’re imported *inside* the `.ts` file for that component. Or switch to CSS Modules or PostCSS if you want scoping.

---

3️⃣ **Add `types/` for shared interfaces**

If your components share props or event types, it’s common to have:

```
src/
 ├── types/
 │   ├── index.ts
```

---

4️⃣ **Consider tests in `__tests__` or colocated**

If you want to grow unit tests:

```
src/
 ├── toggle/
 │   ├── button.ts
 │   ├── button.css
 │   ├── __tests__/
 │   │   ├── button.test.ts
```

Or use a `tests/` folder but run them with a test runner like `vitest` or `jest`.

---

5️⃣ **Consider storybook or a playground**

For a component lib, Storybook or Histoire is a great way to showcase/test props & variations. Much better than only an HTML page.

---

6️⃣ **Add `README.md`**

Your consumers will need instructions for installation, usage, and local dev.

---

### ✅ **Conclusion**

Your structure is absolutely fine — the suggestions above are about **future-proofing** and making it easier for **other devs** (or your future self) to navigate and contribute.

If you want, I can help you:

* Write a `package.json` build/export config for ESM/CJS.
* Add example `index.ts` exports.
* Suggest a basic test setup.
