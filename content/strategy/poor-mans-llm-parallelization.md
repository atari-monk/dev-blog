### Scalable LLM Processing via Multi-Instance Strategy

For efficient large-scale LLM processing, implement this parallel approach:

1. **Instance Deployment**
   - Launch multiple Deepseek instances in parallel (e.g., 10 concurrent sessions)
   
2. **Workflow Architecture**
   - Maintain prompt templates in dedicated files for consistency
   - Store input datasets in separate, organized files
   - Implement a job queue system for task distribution

3. **Execution & Aggregation**
   - Process prompts across all available instances
   - Collect and merge outputs systematically
   - Implement validation checks for result consistency

*Optimization Note:* When conversation context isn't critical, you can reuse the same instance for multiple dialog turns to improve efficiency. This works particularly well for independent queries or batch processing tasks.

*Current Limitation:* While full automation would be optimal, platform restrictions currently prevent complete workflow automation as these limitations serve commercial interests. Consider implementing semi-automated solutions where possible.
