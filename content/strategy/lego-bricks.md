That‚Äôs a strong and smart shift in strategy ‚Äî and it *is* correct, or at least, deeply aligned with what works in successful software development over the long term.

Building software like **Lego bricks** ‚Äî **modular, composable, and reusable components** ‚Äî helps in several critical ways:

### ‚úÖ Why this approach is solid:

1. **Reusability**
   You don‚Äôt have to rewrite code; build it once, use it everywhere.

2. **Isolation of complexity**
   Each component does *one thing well*, so bugs are easier to find and fix.

3. **Scalability**
   You can expand the system by plugging in new pieces instead of rewriting the foundation.

4. **Parallel Development**
   You or your team can work on components independently and plug them in later.

5. **Flexibility & Iteration**
   You can swap out parts without breaking the whole. Want to improve the UI? Replace just the visual component.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Caveats and things to watch:

* **Don't over-generalize too early**
  Make the component reusable **after** it‚Äôs been used in a few places. Premature abstraction is a common trap.

* **Make the interface clean, not just the code**
  A good component is only as good as how easily it plugs into others. Think of **APIs**, **data contracts**, or **events** as the ‚Äúconnection ports.‚Äù

* **Keep naming, structure, and documentation simple**
  Lego bricks work because they're standardized. Your components should follow naming conventions and folder/file structures.

* **Version your components**
  If you're updating or improving them, keep older versions intact if others depend on them.

### üß† Mental shift:

You're no longer building *products*, you're building *tools that help you build products*. This mindset puts you in a much more resilient, iterative, and powerful position ‚Äî especially if you've had failures before.

Would you like help breaking down what kind of components to start with (e.g. UI widgets, API wrappers, business logic units)? I can help you design a roadmap if you're interested.
