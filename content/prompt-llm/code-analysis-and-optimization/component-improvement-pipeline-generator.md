Here are four standardized prompts generated based on your requirements, each using a different format option:

---

**1. Basic Clean Format**  
* Name: Component Optimization Pipeline Creator  
* Input: A software component needing analysis, optimization, and maintainability improvements  
* Task: Design a step-by-step pipeline to analyze, optimize, and enhance the component's maintainability  
* Output: A clear, actionable pipeline with stages for analysis, optimization, and maintainability improvements  

---

**2. Expanded with Context**  
* Name: Component Refactoring and Optimization Pipeline  
* Context/Background: Existing software components often require updates for performance, maintainability, and scalability.  
* Input: A component with potential inefficiencies, technical debt, or maintainability challenges  
* Task/Instruction:  
  1. Analyze the component for performance bottlenecks and maintainability issues.  
  2. Identify optimization opportunities (e.g., code structure, algorithms).  
  3. Propose refactoring steps to improve readability and scalability.  
  4. Outline testing and validation steps for the optimized component.  
* Output/Expected Result: A detailed pipeline with phases for analysis, optimization, refactoring, and validation.

**3. Detailed for Complex Prompts**  
* Name: Comprehensive Component Improvement Pipeline Generator  
* Purpose/Goal: Create a robust pipeline to transform a software component into an optimized, maintainable, and scalable version.  
* Input Data:  
  - Component codebase  
  - Performance metrics (if available)  
  - Existing documentation (if available)  
* Constraints/Requirements:  
  - Pipeline must include analysis, optimization, and maintainability enhancements.  
  - Each stage must have measurable outcomes.  
* Task/Action:  
  1. Perform static and dynamic analysis to identify issues.  
  2. Prioritize optimization targets (e.g., memory usage, runtime).  
  3. Refactor code for clarity and modularity.  
  4. Implement automated testing for validation.  
  5. Document improvements and future maintenance steps.  
* Expected Output/Format: A structured pipeline document with stages, actions, and success criteria.  

---

**4. Minimal & Clear**  
* Prompt Name: Component Improvement Steps  
* Input: A software component requiring optimization and maintainability updates  
* Instruction: List the key steps to analyze, optimize, and improve the component.  
* Output: A concise list of pipeline stages (e.g., analysis, optimization, testing).
